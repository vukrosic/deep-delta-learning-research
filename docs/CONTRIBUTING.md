# 🤝 Research Contributions

We welcome contributions that advance our understanding of Deep Delta Learning (DDL).

## 🛠 How to contribute:

1. 🔍 **Identify a Research Question**: Check the [TODO.md](TODO.md) or open issues for inspiration.
2. 🍴 **Fork the Repository**: Create your own feature branch.
3. 💻 **Implement Experiment**: Modify `models/deepdelta.py` or `models/layers.py` to test your hypothesis.
4. 📊 **Rigorous Benchmarking**:
   - Measure training loss and validation loss.
   - Run benchmarks in `benchmarks/` to ensure no regression in capabilities.
   - Compare results against the current baseline.
5. 📥 **Submit a PR**:
   - Provide a clear explanation of your change and the theoretical motivation.
   - Include plots of loss curves and benchmark results.

## 📜 Principles

- **Clarity over Complexity**: Prefer simple, understandable changes.
- **Data-Driven**: Every architectural change should be justified by improved performance or stability.
- **Collaborative**: Provide feedback on other researchers' PRs to build a robust DDL framework.
