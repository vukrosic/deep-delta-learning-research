# 🏆 Blueberry-Nano Speedrun Leaderboard

> Training is run on 1x4090 RTX.

Usually we will do research together to be able to beat records, but you may also do it alone.

## 📜 Official Rules

To qualify for the **Speedrun** (4.5 loss / 3.5 loss / 1B tokens) leaderboard, your run must follow these rules:

1.  Surpass the record (training loss of **≤ 4.5**, training loss of **≤ 3.5**, fastest training time or lowest validation loss on **1B tokens**).
2.  Use the data mentioned in the [SETUP_INTRUCTIONS](docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
3.  The official metric is **Active Training Time**. Setup and compilation overhead (`Setup & Compilation Time`) is excluded.
4.  Keep the added code minimal, clean and readable.

## ⚡ Fastest To 4.5 Train Loss
*Goal: Fastest Time to Reach Loss ≤ 4.5*
> First benchmark is faster to experiment on. We can later find what transfers to the longer training.

> **Record Repeatability / Noise**:
  - Run 1: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 2: 1m 55s, 494 steps
  - Run 3: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 4: 1m 55s, 494 steps
  - Run 5: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 6: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 7: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 8: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 9: 1m 54s, 494 steps
  - Run 10: 1m 54s, 494 steps

New record should be at least 1m 53s to be sure it is not randomness.

## 🤝 Compute Sponsorship & Verification
**You may rent 4090 affordably at**
[Salad](https://salad.com/pricing) | [Novita](https://novita.ai/pricing?gpu=1) | [VastAI](https://vast.ai/pricing) - A lot of GPU providers also give 50% off on spot billing.

You may also use free L4 at [LightningAI](https://lightning.ai/) - just make sure to measure your baseline as well and then compare. Once you break the record, we will measure it on 4090.

**Can't access a GPU? We've got you.**

1.  **Verification**: If you optimize the code but can't verify the exact time, submit a Pull Request. We will run your code on our 4090 to confirm the record!
2.  **Sponsorship**: If you have a great idea (e.g., a new architecture) but no GPU, open an Issue/Ticket. If the idea looks promising, we will run the experiment for you and credit you.
