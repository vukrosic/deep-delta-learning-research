# 🏆 Blueberry-Nano Speedrun Leaderboard

> Training is run on 1x4090 RTX.

- Model size must stay within ±5% of 151M parameters (approximately 143M–159M).


## ⚡ Fastest To 4.5 Train Loss
*Goal: Fastest Time to Reach Loss ≤ 4.5*
> Everyone is GPU poor, let's make every FLOP count.

## 🤝 Compute Sponsorship & Verification
**You may rent 4090 affordably at**
[Salad](https://salad.com/pricing) | [Novita](https://novita.ai/pricing?gpu=1) | [VastAI](https://vast.ai/pricing) - A lot of GPU providers also give 50% off on spot billing.

You may also use free L4 at [LightningAI](https://lightning.ai/) - just make sure to measure your baseline as well and then compare. Once you break the record, we will measure it on 4090.

**Can't access a GPU? We've got you.**

1.  **Verification**: If you optimize the code but can't verify the exact time, submit a Pull Request. We will run your code on our 4090 to confirm the record!
2.  **Sponsorship**: If you have a great idea (e.g., a new architecture) but no GPU, open an Issue/Ticket. If the idea looks promising, we will run the experiment for you and credit you.
